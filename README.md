## ✨ Align for Free

Feather is an alignment framework for protecting LLM responses and aligning Reasoning Language Models (RLMs) like DeepSeek. With Feather, you can simplify reward engineering, evaluations, and guardrails to tailor model behavior and ensure safe, aligned outputs that match your business objectives through Alignment Fine-Tuning (AFT).

- 🤝 Alignment Reward Functions: Central to guiding and optimizing model behavior, ensuring that both the reasoning process and the outputs align with your intended goals.
- 🧪 Evaluations: Provide quantitative and qualitative metrics to assess the effectiveness of your alignment strategies, enabling continuous improvement.
- 📚 Colab Notebooks: optimized for free T4 GPU to get started

## ✨ Enterprise Edition
- Domain-specific LLMs as a Judge
- Custom Evaluations
- Robust Reward Engineering Platform
- Ultrafast Customized Guardrails
- Alignment orchestrations
